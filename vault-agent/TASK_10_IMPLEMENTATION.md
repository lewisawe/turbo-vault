# Task 10 Implementation: Security Hardening and Compliance Features

## Overview

Task 10 has been successfully completed, implementing comprehensive security hardening and compliance features for the KeyVault decentralized key management platform. This implementation addresses requirements 2.2, 2.4, 4.5, and 8.5 from the specifications.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Security Hardening (`hardening.go`)
- **File Permission Hardening**: Automatically secures sensitive directories and files with proper permissions (700 for directories, 600 for files)
- **Network Security Hardening**: Validates network configurations and checks for dangerous open ports
- **Process Security Hardening**: Sets resource limits and drops unnecessary capabilities
- **TLS Hardening**: Enforces TLS 1.3, secure cipher suites, and mutual TLS authentication
- **Configuration Validation**: Continuously validates security configuration and reports issues

### 2. Vulnerability Scanner (`vulnerability_scanner.go`)
- **CVE Database Integration**: Scans for known vulnerabilities using CVE databases
- **Dependency Analysis**: Analyzes Go modules, Node.js packages, and Python requirements
- **Configuration Scanning**: Detects security issues in configuration files
- **Multi-format Reporting**: Exports results in JSON, HTML, and CSV formats
- **Automated Recommendations**: Provides actionable security recommendations

### 3. Security Test Suite (`security_test_suite.go`)
- **Authentication Testing**: Tests password policies, brute force protection, session management, and MFA
- **TLS/SSL Testing**: Validates TLS versions, cipher suites, and certificate validation
- **Input Validation Testing**: Tests for SQL injection, XSS, and command injection vulnerabilities
- **Access Control Testing**: Validates privilege escalation and unauthorized access protection
- **Network Security Testing**: Performs port scanning and protocol security validation

### 4. Security Manager (`manager.go`)
- **Centralized Orchestration**: Coordinates all security components and operations
- **Automated Scheduling**: Performs periodic scans and tests based on configurable intervals
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates executive-level security reports with findings and action plans
- **Security Scoring**: Calculates overall security scores and determines security levels
- **Background Monitoring**: Continuously monitors security posture and generates alerts

### 5. CLI Integration (`cmd/security.go`)
- **Security Commands**: Provides comprehensive CLI commands for all security operations
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Supports JSON, YAML, and table output formats
- **Flexible Configuration**: Allows customization of security settings and parameters
- **Batch Operations**: Supports bulk security operations and reporting

### Security Testing Framework
- ✅ Comprehensive security test suite with 25+ test categories
- ✅ Attack simulation and vulnerability testing
- ✅ Automated security regression testing
- ✅ Performance impact assessment of security measures

## Integration Points

### Main Application Integration
- Security manager is initialized during application startup
- TLS configuration is automatically hardened using security manager
- Security endpoints are exposed via REST API
- Background security monitoring runs continuously

### CLI Integration
- `vault-agent security harden` - Apply security hardening measures
- `vault-agent security scan` - Perform vulnerability scanning
- `vault-agent security test` - Run security test suite
- `vault-agent security compliance` - Generate compliance reports
- `vault-agent security status` - Show security status
- `vault-agent security report` - Generate comprehensive security report

### API Integration
- `/api/v1/security/status` - Get current security status
- `/api/v1/security/scan` - Trigger security scan
- `/api/v1/security/test` - Run security tests

## Security Improvements Delivered

1. **Proactive Security**: Continuous monitoring and automated testing
2. **Compliance Automation**: Automated compliance reporting and validation
3. **Vulnerability Management**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanning and management
4. **Security Hardening**: Automated application of security best practices
5. **Risk Assessment**: Continuous risk assessment and scoring
6. **Incident Response**: Automated detection and alerting of security issues
