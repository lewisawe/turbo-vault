# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Decentralized Key Management Platform is a self-hosted solution that enables developers to securely manage their secrets, API keys, and sensitive configuration data while maintaining full control over their infrastructure. Unlike traditional centralized key management services, this platform operates on a decentralized architecture where customers deploy vault agents on their own servers, ensuring secrets never leave their controlled environment. The platform provides a centralized management interface for monitoring, automation, and policy enforcement while preserving data sovereignty and compliance requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy a vault agent on my own infrastructure, so that I can store secrets locally while benefiting from centralized management capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user downloads the vault agent THEN the system SHALL provide Docker containers, Kubernetes manifests, and native binaries for major operating systems
2. WHEN a user deploys the vault agent THEN the system SHALL automatically create encrypted local storage with AES-256-GCM encryption
3. WHEN the vault agent starts THEN the system SHALL generate unique client certificates for secure communication with the control plane
4. IF the vault agent cannot connect to the control plane THEN the system SHALL continue operating in offline mode with full local functionality
5. WHEN the vault agent is deployed THEN the system SHALL provide a local web interface accessible on a configurable port

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all secrets to be encrypted at rest and in transit, so that sensitive data remains protected even if infrastructure is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN secrets are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using AES-256-GCM with customer-managed encryption keys
2. WHEN secrets are transmitted THEN the system SHALL use TLS 1.3 with mutual authentication between vault agent and control plane
3. WHEN encryption keys are generated THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random number generation with entropy from the operating system
4. WHEN the vault agent communicates with the control plane THEN the system SHALL never transmit actual secret values, only encrypted metadata
5. WHEN a vault agent is compromised THEN the system SHALL ensure secrets remain encrypted and inaccessible without the master key

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to manage secrets through both API and web interface, so that I can integrate secret management into my automation workflows and manual processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the vault agent THEN the system SHALL provide a RESTful API with endpoints for CRUD operations on secrets
2. WHEN using the API THEN the system SHALL support authentication via API keys, client certificates, or JWT tokens
3. WHEN managing secrets through the web interface THEN the system SHALL provide an intuitive dashboard showing secret metadata, usage statistics, and health status
4. WHEN creating or updating secrets THEN the system SHALL validate input data and provide clear error messages for invalid requests
5. WHEN listing secrets THEN the system SHALL return metadata only, requiring explicit requests to retrieve actual secret values

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit logging of all secret operations, so that I can track access patterns and meet regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any secret operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log the action, timestamp, user identity, and operation details
2. WHEN audit logs are generated THEN the system SHALL store them locally on the vault agent with optional forwarding to external systems
3. WHEN accessing audit logs THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and search capabilities by date, user, operation type, and secret name
4. WHEN audit logs reach configured size limits THEN the system SHALL rotate logs automatically while preserving historical data
5. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and optionally disable the affected vault agent

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated secret rotation capabilities, so that I can maintain security best practices without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring secret rotation THEN the system SHALL allow setting rotation policies based on time intervals, usage counts, or external triggers
2. WHEN a secret rotation is due THEN the system SHALL generate notifications through configurable channels (email, webhook, Slack)
3. WHEN rotating secrets automatically THEN the system SHALL support custom rotation scripts and integration with external systems
4. WHEN a rotation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and alert administrators after maximum retry attempts
5. WHEN secrets are rotated THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and allow rollback to previous versions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want a centralized control plane to monitor multiple vault agents, so that I can have visibility across my entire secret management infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vault agents register with the control plane THEN the system SHALL display their status, version, and basic metadata in a unified dashboard
2. WHEN monitoring vault agents THEN the system SHALL collect and display usage metrics, health status, and performance statistics
3. WHEN vault agents go offline THEN the system SHALL detect the disconnection and alert administrators within 5 minutes
4. WHEN managing multiple vault agents THEN the system SHALL provide bulk operations for policy deployment and configuration updates
5. WHEN viewing the control plane dashboard THEN the system SHALL never display actual secret values, only aggregated statistics and metadata

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with popular development tools and CI/CD pipelines, so that I can seamlessly incorporate secret management into my existing workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with CI/CD systems THEN the system SHALL provide plugins or CLI tools for Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Azure DevOps
2. WHEN accessing secrets from applications THEN the system SHALL provide SDKs for popular programming languages (Python, Node.js, Go, Java, .NET)
3. WHEN using the CLI tool THEN the system SHALL support all vault agent operations with human-readable output and machine-parseable JSON formats
4. WHEN integrating with container orchestration THEN the system SHALL provide Kubernetes operators and Helm charts for easy deployment
5. WHEN connecting to external systems THEN the system SHALL support integration with cloud provider secret managers for hybrid deployments

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want fine-grained access control and policy enforcement, so that I can implement least-privilege access to secrets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring access control THEN the system SHALL support role-based access control (RBAC) with customizable roles and permissions
2. WHEN users access secrets THEN the system SHALL enforce policies based on user identity, time of day, network location, and request context
3. WHEN defining policies THEN the system SHALL allow administrators to set approval workflows for sensitive operations
4. WHEN policy violations occur THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the violation with detailed context information
5. WHEN managing user permissions THEN the system SHALL support integration with external identity providers (LDAP, Active Directory, SAML, OIDC)

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a backup administrator, I want automated backup and disaster recovery capabilities, so that I can ensure business continuity in case of system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring backups THEN the system SHALL support automated encrypted backups to local storage, network shares, and cloud storage providers
2. WHEN performing backups THEN the system SHALL include all secrets, configuration, audit logs, and metadata while maintaining encryption
3. WHEN restoring from backup THEN the system SHALL verify backup integrity and provide options for full or selective restoration
4. WHEN backup operations fail THEN the system SHALL retry automatically and alert administrators if failures persist
5. WHEN testing disaster recovery THEN the system SHALL provide tools to validate backup completeness and restoration procedures

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the system to handle high-throughput secret operations efficiently, so that it doesn't become a bottleneck in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing secret requests THEN the system SHALL handle at least 1000 requests per second per vault agent instance
2. WHEN scaling horizontally THEN the system SHALL support multiple vault agent instances with shared storage backends
3. WHEN caching secrets THEN the system SHALL implement configurable in-memory caching with automatic cache invalidation
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL expose Prometheus metrics for request latency, throughput, and error rates
